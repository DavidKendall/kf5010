# Introduction

This lab encourages you to develop your understanding of thread scheduling
and mutex attributes as they might arise in the development of concurrent systems.

# In the lab

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises from previous weeks.

1. Clone the git repository for the lab. Build and run the first program.

   ``` shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/kf5010_L11
   $ cd kf5010_L11
   $ gcc -Wall -o sched01 sched01.c
   $ ./sched01
   ```
This program simply reports on the minimum and maximum values that can be used
in specifying thread priorities for each of the scheduling policies
`SCHED_OTHER`, `SCHED_FIFO`, and `SCHED_RR`. Notice that `SCHED_FIFO` and
`SCHED_RR` allow the use of priority values from 1 to 99 (where 1 is the lowest
priority and 99 is the highest priority). `SCHED_OTHER` threads have a default
priority of 0. This can be modified by the use of the `nice` command (see
`man nice`).

1. Now build and run the second program.

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -Wall -c console_safe.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o sched02 -pthread sched02.c console_safe.o -lncursesw
   $ ./sched02
   ```
You will probably find that your program fails with a message similar to the
following

   ```
   sched02: sched02.c:40: main: Assertion `rc == 0' failed.
   ```
Look at the code for `sched02.c`. Find the line that causes the assertion
violation. You should see that the code immediately preceding this line
is attempting to create a new thread with a `SCHED_FIFO` scheduling policy.
This attempt fails because you do not have adequate permissions to perform
this operation. (`SCHED_FIFO` threads run at a higher priority than all
`SCHED_OTHER` threads. If anyone could create `SCHED_FIFO` threads they could
hog the CPU. Hence, this is a restricted operation). You can get around this
problem for now by running the program as supervisor.

   ``` shell_session
   $ sudo ./sched02
   ```
The behaviour that you see now will depend on whether or not your system has
more than one CPU. In the case of more than one CPU, you should see that
two threads execute, each one incrementing a counter and displaying its
value on the console, e.g.

   ```
   Thread 0 : 0000012345
   Thread 1 : 0000009876
   ```
If your system has only one CPU, then you will find that only the highest
priority of the two threads is able to execute. This is thread 1. Look at the
code for `sched02.c`. Explain why thread 1 is a higher priority than thread 0.
If you are running your program on a system with multiple CPUs, you can still
observe the behaviour that would occur on a single-CPU system by forcing
all of your threads to be scheduled on the same CPU, e.g.

   ``` shell_session
   $ taskset -c 0 sudo ./sched02
   ```
Here the `taskset` command forces all of your threads to be bound to processor 0,
giving the same effect as if your program was running on a system with a single
CPU. (Use `man taskset` for a more detailed explanation of the `taskset` command.)
In this case, you should see output similar to the following

   ```

   Thread 1 : 0000123456
   ```
Now modify `sched02.c` by uncommenting the line in `count_thr` immediately
after the line `counter += 1;`. This adds a short delay to the thread after
every iteration. Rebuild and run the program again (ensuring single CPU
behaviour).

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -Wall -o sched02 -pthread sched02.c console_safe.o -lncursesw
   $ taskset -c 0 sudo ./sched02
   ```
Now you should see that both threads are able to make progress and the output
looks something like the following

   ```
   Thread 0 : 0000000050
   Thread 1 : 0000000051
   ```
Explain carefully why it is that both threads can make progress now. Discuss
this with your lab tutor if you're not sure.

1. Now build and run the third program.

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o sched03 -pthread sched03.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ taskset -c 0 sudo ./sched03
   ```
The behaviour of this program is similar to your last program but now we
have included the use of a priority ceiling mutex (`PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT`).
Look carefully at the code for `sched03.c` to see how the mutex has been
created. Note that its use is no different than that of a default mutex. 
Answer the following questions:
    1. Which line of code declares the attribute variable for the mutex?
    1. Which line of code initialises the mutex attribute?
    1. Which line of code sets the mutex protocol for the priority ceiling
protocol?
    1. Which line of code sets the ceiling priority of the mutex?
    1. What is the value of the ceiling priority that has been set?
    1. Which line of code initialises the mutex?
    1. Why is it acceptable now to link the program with `console.o` rather
than `console_safe.o`?

1. Add code to `sched03.c` to read the protocol value and ceiling value of the
mutex attribute immediately after setting them. Add assertions to check that
the read operations are successful and the returned values match those that
were set. Use the [POSIX standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
for information about the operations 
required by searching for `pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol` and 
`pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling`.

1. Continue to make progress with the assignment.
